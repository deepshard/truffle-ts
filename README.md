# truffle-ts
The truffle typescript package as a wrapper on top of the REST API

## Getting an API key
To get an API key and try truffle out, please email b@deepshard.org. We're currently only onboarding users with a burning need for an 'unsafe' tunable model, so if you're just trying to try out the package, chances are we wont have spare capacity. Either way - email us to request access

## Contributing
Anyone can contribute to the truffle-ts library. This is a massive WIP, and we want to be the best dev interface for you to use when dealing with language models. Please consider opening a PR or asking for more infromation by opening up an issue.
